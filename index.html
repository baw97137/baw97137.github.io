	<p> The Atlanta Braves, known affectionately as “The Bravos,” have been in Atlanta since 1966. The Braves have won several National League Pennants, fourteen division titles, and even one World Series. The Braves are coached and managed by Brian Snitiker, and owned by Liberty Media Corporation. The Braves for years were broadcast on nationally available TBS and earned a huge nationwide following, earning them the name “America’s Team.”</p>
	<p>To a young kid growing up just outside of Atlanta, there was absolutely nothing like watching the Atlanta Braves play on a summer afternoon. I was always a huge Braves fan from an early age, and have been fortunate to watch some of Atlanta’s greatest players over the years. I grew up watching Rafael Furcal, Andruw Jones, Chipper Jones, Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and other legendary players take the Braves to 9 winning seasons and several playoff victories. Though today the Braves no longer play in the classic Turner Field, the Braves organization is making new strides and moving into a new ballpark of epic proportions.</p>
	<P>That new ballpark, is SunTrust Park. SunTrust park will feature a large lake water feature, high tech turf, statues, museum, and a shopping area. Food will be provided by Georgia Institutions such as Terrapin Beer, Fox Bros Barbeque, Waffle House and more. SunTrust Park will seat 41,000 people and will open April 14th, 2017.</p>
